The following document describes the detailed workflow and results of the analyses.

## Workflow

Please refer to the following diagram for clearer understanding of the workflow and the order in which the analysis steps were performed.

### Raw data

This project used three kinds of input raw data: genomic short Illumina reads and genomic long PacBio reads, as well as transcriptomic short Illumina reads. All the input files were in **.fq.gz** format

The given input data belonged to three different scaffolds (6, 10 and 11). All analyses up to feature counting are performed for all three of these scaffolds, using either separate code files or one for all. For the last two steps of the analysis, due to lack of time, only results from scaffold 10 are used.

The reads represent nine different combinations of two plant cultivara (Musang King or Monthong) and four plant organs, corresponding to a specific experiment ID. These are presented below:

- SRR6040092  Musang King leaf
- SRR6040093  Musang King root
- SRR6040094  Musang King aril
- SRR6040095  Musang King aril
- SRR6040096  Musang King stem
- SRR6040097  Musang King aril
- SRR6156066  Monthong  aril
- SRR6156067  Monthong  aril
- SRR6156069  Monthong  aril

### Short reads preprocessing

Raw illumina reads, both genomic and transcriptomic, were Quality Controlled, trimmed, and Quality Controlled again. The programs used were **FastQC** and **Trimmomatic**. The code for these jobs can be found in folders "DNA_prep_illumina" and "RNA_prep". Transcriptome reads from only one experiment (SRR6040095) needed trimming, and the rest were left unchanged.

The genomic reads passed QC well, while transcriptomic reads did not (both before and after trimming), failing among others in metrics of overrepresenteed sequences and per sequence GC content. The analysis was nevertheless continued with the same data.

### Initial assembly

The initial assembly was made using long genomic PacBio reads. No initial preprocessing was made, because the assembly software used - **Canu** - includes a QC. The command outputed a **.fasta** file with an assembly. The code for this job can be found in folder "DNA_prep_assembly_pacbio".

### Assembly improvement

The assembly based on genomic long reads was further improved using genomic short reads. The reads were first indexed and aligned to the assembly using software **BWA** with options **index** and **mem**, creating an alignment file in **.sam** format. The alignment was converted to a compressed format **.bam**, as well as sorted by position and indexed, using **SAMtools**.

The initial assembly was subsequently corrected with the alignment using software **Pilon**. The final assembly was Quality Controlled using **QUAST** and the sequence repeats were softmasked using **RepeatMasker**.

The code for these jobs can be found in folder "DNA_post_assembly_pacbio".

The final assembly of scaffold 10 consists of 614 contigs, all of which more than 1000bp in size and has GC content of 31.44%. The following plots generated by **QUAST** describe the cumulative length of contigs and the GC content distribution in the assembly:

### Genome annotation

The transcriptome reads were aligned (splice-aware) to the final genome assembly using **STAR**, and the alignment file was compressed, sorted and indexed using **SAMtools** as in the previous step. Next, the final genome was annotated using the alignment files, with software **BRAKER**. This produced feature files in **.gtf** and **.gff** formats. The code for these jobs can be found in folder "RNA_alignment" and "DNA_annotation". 

### Feature counting and differential expression analysis

Genomic features were counted from the **.gtf** file using **HTseq**, and the resulting count file was used for expression comparison between the different cultivars and different plant organs using R package **DEseq2**.  For each analysis, three graphs were created to represent the result: an MA-plot, PCA-plot and an expression heatmap. Due to lack of time, names of the most expressed genes were not able to be retrieved via **eggNOGmapper** and were instead borrowed from a classmate working on the same project. These are the gene names used in heatmaps.

MA-plot for expression analysis between cultivars:

In the plot, each dot represents a gene and red dots specifically represent genes with p-value > 0.1. The y-axis is -- and x-axis shows average expression in all samples. The plot suggests quite high differences in expression patterns between the two cultivars, and also has interestingly straight lines in the left corner, which is not exactly normal for this kind of plots. The values are not either evenly dispersed in relation to the x-axis.

## Conclusions
Genome assembly results are good. However, the results of the expression analysis are less satisfactory. The expresison heatmaps show much larger difference between different cultivars than plant organs, which is the opposite of the expected result, since dofferent plant organs have drastic functional differences, unlike different cultivars. The best option would be redoing differential expression analysis with more time, and preferably checking the quality of annotation results.
